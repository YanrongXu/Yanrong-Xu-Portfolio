When I talk to a recruiter, i find out the most of the recruiter don't have a handy tool
to organize the applicants and send it within the organizations. So i create the tool,
to help recruiter. This tool was a chrome extensions. 

This little app give recruiter ability to add applicant to the database and send the
quantify applicant to the right department in the organization.
