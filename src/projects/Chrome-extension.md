When I talked to recruiters during my own job search, I quickly found that most recruiters don't have a tool to organize and communicate about applicants within their organization. I created this app to fill that need for recruiters, it is a Chrome extension that allows users to place quality applicants in the right departments' hiring pipeline. Builtin React/Redux, Node.js, Express, Postgres, and Webpack.
