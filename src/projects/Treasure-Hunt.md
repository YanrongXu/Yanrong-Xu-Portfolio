When I'm not coding, I spend my nights thinking about playing a game where I can walk around mystery rooms and discover treasure. After I realized this game did not yet exist (at least not the way I wanted to build it!) I went about working to to create this game. This little game may be seem annoying at first, but if you walk around the room, you discover there are so many things you can find. The MUD game's front-end was built with React and the back-end was built with a Django REST-API.
